## 📁 Project Structure

### 🚀 `ProjectQT/`
This is the **Sketcher Project Directory** and the focus of my internship.  
It contains the core implementation, source code, and related assets for the project assigned during the internship.


### 🧪 Other Directories
All other directories in the repository are dedicated to **learning exercises**, **proof-of-concept experiments**, or **technology explorations**.  
These were useful in understanding key concepts and tools required for the main project and personal development during the internship.
